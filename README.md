# CSCI215_Assignment_2_William Hundahl 

## Due 10 Oct 2017 @ 11:59 pm

The purpose of this assignment is for you to get practice doing “generic” programming activities using JavaScript. Each problem is worth 20% of the grade. You need to:
* Create separate .html files for each of the following JavaScript programming problems below. 

## randompic.html

Randomly display 1 of 5 images on the screen when the page is loaded. Use whatever (PG) images you’d like.

## processtext.html

Create a webpage that has an input \<div\>, an output \<div\>, and a button that when clicked it processes the text in the input \<div\> and places the results in the output \<div\>.
Processing means: List all occurrences of each word along with their count. Matching is case-insensitive. For example (ordering of output is not important):

Input \<DIV\>						
The cat ate the bird. 					
The Bird ate the Dog. 					
The dog ate the cat.					

Output \<DIV\>
THE 6
CAT 2
ATE 3
BIRD 2
DOG 2

## mathfun.html

Create a JavaScript program that calculates the maximum, minimum, mean, and median values of a set of numbers as well as the number of even numbers, odd numbers, prime numbers, and power-of-2 numbers.
Using prompt pop-up box, ask a user to enter positive numbers one at a time. 
Also tell them at if they enter a -1 that means they are finished.
Display the result in a nicely formatted table in the body of the website.

## morsecode.html
 
Create a webpage that has an input \<div\>, an output \<div\>, and a button that when clicked it processes the text in the input \<div\> and places the results in the output \<div\>.
Processing means: converting the Morse Code in the input \<div\> to English in the output div.
Morse code represents characters of an alphabet as sequences of dits (short key closures) and dahs (longer key closures). If we let a period (.) represent a dit and a dash (-) represent a dah, then the Morse code version of the English alphabet is

| | | | | |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| A .-   | G --.  | M --   | S ...  | Y -.-- |
| B -... | H .... | N -.   | T -    | Z --.. |
| C -.-. | I ..   | O ---  | U ..-  |        |
| D -..  | J .--- | P .--. | V ...- |        |
| E .    | K -.-. | Q --.- | W .--  |        |
| F ..-. | L .-.. | R .-.  | X -..- |        |

One blank space is used to separate letters and three blanks are used to separate words. Here is an example:

Input \<div\>									Output \<div\>

-.-. --- ..-. -.-.   .-. --- -.-. -.- ...			COFC ROCKS



## emailverify.html

Create a webpage that has an input \<div\>, an output \<div\>, and a button that when clicked it processes the text in the input \<div\> and places the results in the output \<div\>.
  * Processing means: check to see if the input \<div\> contains a valid email address, which means:
    * One or more characters followed by an @ followed by one or more characters followed by a dot (.) followed by one or more characters.
  * If the email address is valid display a smiley face pic in the output \<div\>. 
  * If the email address is not valid display a frowny face pic in the output \<div\>


THIS IS INDIVIDUAL WORK ONLY. IF I SUSPECT THE CODE IS NOT YOURS, YOU WILL NEED TO COME TO MY OFFICE TO TAKE A VERBAL TEST ON THE CODE YOU SUBMITTED.
